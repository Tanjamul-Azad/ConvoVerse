# 🌐 ConvoVerse  
## *An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Social Practice System for Introverted Learners*

**Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) | AI for Social Participation**

> *Designing AI not to replace human interaction,  
but to help humans feel ready to participate.*

</div>

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

**ConvoVerse** is an HCI-focused, LLM-powered multi-agent interactive system designed to support introverted and socially hesitant learners in developing confidence for communication and participation.

Rather than forcing direct real-world interaction, ConvoVerse provides a **psychologically safe, low-pressure simulated environment** where users can practice conversations, observe social dynamics, and gradually prepare for real-life participation.

The system positions AI as a **supportive facilitator**, not a replacement for human interaction.

---

## 🚩 Motivation & Problem Context

Many capable learners experience difficulty in participation due to:
- Fear of speaking in classrooms or group discussions  
- Anxiety during presentations or collaborative activities  
- Social withdrawal despite strong academic ability  

Most existing educational platforms emphasize **content delivery**, while overlooking **social readiness, emotional comfort, and participation confidence**.

ConvoVerse addresses this critical gap through **interaction-centered, emotionally aware design**.

---

## 🧠 Core Concept

ConvoVerse simulates realistic social interaction scenarios using **multiple AI agents**, each representing a distinct social role:

- 👤 Peer  
- 👥 Group Member  
- 🧑‍🏫 Facilitator  

Users engage in guided interactions that **gradually increase in social complexity**, supported by adaptive flow and reflective feedback.

## ✨ Key Features & Design Highlights

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Social Simulation
- AI agents model realistic peer-to-peer and group discussion dynamics  

### 🧭 Gradual Participation Scaffolding
- Observer Mode → One-on-One → Small-Group interaction  

### 🛡️ Psychological Safety by Design
- Private, non-judgmental, pressure-free interaction space  
- No public exposure, no scoring, no forced participation  

### 🎛️ Adaptive Interaction Flow
- Conversation pacing and complexity adjust to user comfort  

### 🧠 Interaction Style Calibration (Optional)
- Lightweight, non-diagnostic calibration to personalize AI behavior  

### 🔄 Rewind & Retry
- Safely explore alternative responses without penalty  

### 👀 Observer Mode
- Learn by watching AI agents interact before participating  

### 📝 Reflective Feedback
- Non-evaluative post-session reflection for confidence building  

### 🎨 HCI-Centered Interface
- Low cognitive load  
- High transparency  
- Strong user autonomy

## 👥 Intended Users

- Introverted university students  
- Socially anxious or low-confidence learners  
- First-year students adapting to discussion-based learning environments  

---

## 🧪 Research Methodology (HCI-Oriented)

- **Design Approach:** User-centered design grounded in psychological safety and gradual exposure  
- **Prototype:** Interactive frontend demonstrating full interaction flow  
- **Evaluation (Planned):**
  - Usability testing  
  - Guided interaction tasks  
  - Reflection logs  
  - Semi-structured interviews  

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes & Impact

- Improved confidence in discussions and group activities  
- Increased readiness for real-world classroom participation  
- Better inclusion of quiet but capable learners  
- A reusable HCI design framework for AI-supported social practice

## 🔬 Research & HCI Contribution

This project contributes to HCI research by:
- Exploring LLM-based multi-agent interaction for social practice  
- Translating psychological safety principles into interaction design  
- Demonstrating AI’s role as a **supportive facilitator**, not a replacement  
- Proposing a replicable model for participation-support systems  

---

## 🚧 Scope & Limitations

- Research prototype (not a full production system)  
- Focus on interaction design and user experience  
- Short-term confidence and perception, not long-term behavioral change  

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack (Prototype)

- **Frontend:** Modern Web UI (React / Next.js – optional)  
- **AI Layer:** LLM-based conversational agents  
- **Design Focus:** HCI principles over technical complexity  

---

## 📌 Project Status

🟡 **In Progress**  
- Frontend prototype completed  
- Core interaction flow designed  
- User evaluation planned
